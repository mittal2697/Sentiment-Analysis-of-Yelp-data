# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-data

Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive analysis of a Yelp reviews dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to develop machine learning models for sentiment analysis and predict restaurant ratings based on Yelp reviews. Here are the key highlights of this project:

1. Text Cleaning Techniques for Dataset Uniformity

Implemented text cleaning techniques to remove redundancy and ensure dataset uniformity.
2. NLP Analysis of Yelp Reviews Dataset

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a Yelp reviews dataset using NLP techniques such as tokenization, POS tagging, and NER.
3. Stemming and Lemmatization for Word Reduction

Utilized stemming and lemmatization techniques to reduce words to their root form, enhancing sentiment analysis and identification.
4. Developed and Evaluated Machine Learning Models for Sentiment Analysis

Developed and evaluated machine learning models for sentiment analysis, predicting restaurant ratings based on Yelp reviews.
5. Generated Word Clouds to Visualize Prominent Words

Generated word clouds to visualize prominent words in positive and negative reviews for specific restaurants.
